Initial thoughts on the project were great job. All around a very nice application with more than needed. 
I liked the sounds and the extra things you added that weren't even in the requirments. 
The code comments were also good, I can see the thought process and what's going on through them 
like where it searches for products on hand that are specified. 
Overall a great application.
