Matrix database linq chapter 14  all applications are in one app.  14.6 is a new form  (seperate program) 
Instead of making a bunch of different applications,  I hope this makes it a little easier and faster on you,  I basically wraped all the first 5 into one application since they were not mutally exclusive with what 
the instructions were.
however 14.6 was since it wanted a sort in ascending order by price,  I made that into a seperate form,  there is a button called 14.6  witha  picture of neo taking the red pill to open up the new application
