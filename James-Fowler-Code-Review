I enjoyed the Matrix theme but in regards to the size of the program when I made it full screen the background was just a bit much on the eyes.
The code looked good and how you handled data retrieval errors was dealt with well.
The comments were great and I understood what was going on.
This was probably just an oversight but the first two buttons names do not end in button such as "SearchButton" while the last two buttons do. This is more of just a looks nice kind of thing but again probably just oversight.
