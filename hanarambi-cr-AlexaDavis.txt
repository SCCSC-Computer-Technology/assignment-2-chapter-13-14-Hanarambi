Positive feedback
-Nice graphics
-overall well organized

-The choice of variable names is excellent.
 Variables like descriptionText, units, and productNo are self-explanatory,
 making the code easy to understand without the need for excessive comments.
-Proper management of resources is evident, such as creating a new SoundPlayer 
instance within the try block and catching exceptions for potential errors.

Overall feedback
-The code assumes the database connection (productData) is successful during form initialization. 
Consider adding error handling for potential database connection issues.
-Could use additional comments explaining each portion of the program
