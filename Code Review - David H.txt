[] The code compiles, no warnings. Data grid populates and sorts correctly. All sounds working.
[] Variable names are descriptive. Comments are straightforward, effective. I agree with your take on commenting.
[] I found no unused code or code that could be eliminated.
[] I noticed the product number and description don't create dialog for no input, but don't result in unwanted behavior.
The others check for valid int/decimal parse.
[] I seem to be the only one who broke up the three sections of the problem into their own programs, which made it pretty easy as they all behaved similarly.
I'm starting to think I did it wrong now.
I would have structured mine similarly if they were combined. The upside to your approach is that all functions are one screen, save for the price range.
[] Have you looked into getting multiple sounds to play on top of each other?
Apparently the builtin soundplayer class doesn't natively support it without doing some crazy workarounds.
I think you have to use the imported dll WinMM API. Haven't tried it yet though.
